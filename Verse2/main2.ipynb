These clever seals know and are happily sharing their secrets With tracking devices attached to their heads, seals can provide us with more information about the ocean floor when they deep dive. Photo: Clive R. McMahon/IMOS/SIMS Photo: Clive R. McMahon/IMOS/SIMS Seals are helping scientists to better understand the deep ocean. Clive McMahon works on an elephant seal tagging project at the University of Tasmania in Australia. He also works with the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS). McMahon said that deep-diving seals can provide scientists with a wealth of information on the structure of the ocean floor. To gather this information, McMahon and his team attached small satellite-linked devices to seals. (A satellite is a machine that orbits the planet. Some satellites send radio signals that can be used to track things down on Earth.) The devices took measurements of temperature and depth as the seals swam. McMahon\\'s team tracked more than 500,000 individual seal dives beneath the East Antarctic continental shelf. A continental shelf is the edge of a continent that lies under the ocean.By Australian Geographic, adapted by Newsela staf f on 09.17.23 Word Count 662 Level 1040L\"], \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\", \"encoding_format\": \"base64\"}' message='Post details'\n",

Image 1. The satellite-linked devices measure water conditions as the seals swim at deep depths in the ocean. Photo: Clive R. McMahon/IMOS/SIMSContinents are the seven main divisions of land on Earth. Seals in the East Antarctic continental shelf region have been equipped with satellite-linked devices since 2004. \\\\\"Only a small part of the Antarctic continental shelf was surveyed by ships in the past,\\\\\" McMahon said. \\\\\"So the information available about this area is sparse.\\\\\" But seals are helping scientists fill in the pieces to this puzzle. In July 2023, McMahon and his team published a study about their work with deep-diving seals. The study was published in a scientific journal. Seals Prove Previous Depth Estimates W rong Information from seal dives is helping scientists understand how the ocean affects Antarctica\\'s role in global climate. Climate refers to weather patterns over a long period of time, usually 30 years or more. \\\\\"We found in some regions that more than 25 percent of previous estimates of the ocean depths were wrong,\\\\\" said Mark Hindell, who also worked on the study. \\\\\"We only know this now because the seals were diving hundreds of meters below those depths.\\\\\" In extreme cases, he says, they dove more than 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) deeper than what scientists thought was the bottom of the ocean. The data, or information, from the dives also revealed new underwater features. They revealed new troughs. A trough is a long, wide and deep sunken area in the ocean floor. Thanks to the seals, the scientists also found a deep canyon near the Vanderford Glacier. A glacier is a slow-moving river of ice hundreds or thousands of meters deep. Observations Help Scientists Measure Melt Rates The observations collected from the seals are helping scientists better understand the shape of the ocean floor, especially where there are channels for warm water to access ice shelf cavities, said McMahon. Ice shelves are floating pieces of ice. They extend from grounded glaciers on land. Sometimes, empty holes known as cavities form on the underside of ice shelves. The cavities allow warm water to reach and melt more of the ice. \\\\\"This knowledge is essential for scientists trying to measure ice sheet melt rates,\\\\\" McMahon said. An ice sheet, also known as a continental glacier, is a chunk of glacier ice that covers the land surrounding it and is greater than 50,000 kilometers (20,000 miles) wide. The East Antarctic ice sheet is particularly important as it locks in more than 52 meters (171 feet) of global sea level rise. Sea level rise is a measurement of how fast our planet is changing. As global temperature goes up, ice trapped on land begins to melt, and sea level rises. Water also expands as its temperature increases. \\\\\"As the climate changes, greater intrusions of warm water into the shelf cavities are more likely,\\\\\" Hindell said. Data from satellite-tagged seals can help scientists understand this process. It can help them figure out exactly where water is coming into contact with the bottom of ice shelves.\"], \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\", \"encoding_format\": \"base64\"}' message='Post details'\n",

In creating it, he\\nsays they also introduced users to \"Hamilton\" if they didn\\'t already know it and inspired passion in\\nthose who were already fans.\\nThe game has the blessing of writer-composer Lin-Manuel Miranda. His blockbuster musical\\ncharts the rise and fall of statesman Alexander Hamilton and stresses his orphan, immigrant roots\\nas well as his tragic end. Hamilton died in a duel with Aaron Burr, who was vice president of the\\nUnited States at the time.\\nSongs From The Musical Defeat Enemies\\nRoblox is the largest immersive gaming platform on the planet. Businesses like Mattel, the NFL\\nand Cirque du Soleil have all planted a flag there, as have fashion labels like Vans, Ralph Lauren,\\nNike and Gucci.\\n\"If you are an intellectual property owner and you want to connect to the younger generations —\\npeople really under 25 and particularly under 18 — that\\'s where they socialize. That\\'s where they\\nlearn. More than half of Gen Z expects to discover a brand for the first time in an immersive\\nspace,\" Edelman says. Intellectual property is a legal category for an idea or work that one creates\\nor invents and is then able to legally own.\\nHamilton is a simulator game, meaning it mimics activities a person would do in the real world.\\nThe \"Hamilton\" simulator players assemble a squad from characters in the musical to confront the\\nredcoats, or the British army. Victories earn coins, which can be used to better arm companions as\\nstronger enemies lurk.\\nThe 10 settings include a tavern, George Washington\\'s office, town squares, the ballroom where\\nHamilton and his wife, Angelica Schuyler, fall in love and the Battle of Yorktown. Each level has\\nsongs from the musical, including \"Guns and Ships,\" \"You\\'ll Be Back\" and \"The Schuyler Sisters.\"\\nThe songs are also used as a sort of sonic laser to wear down and defeat enemies.\\n\"For us, being able to allow the player to connect to the characters and the music was really\\nimportant. And that really inspired the general approach to the gameplay,\" Edelman says.\\n\"It Has That Feel Of Belonging Everywhere\"\\nThe simulator currently ends around the midpoint of the musical, with British rule defeated and a\\nnascent country needing its Founders to guide it into becoming a nation of laws. Edelman says the\\nnext step is to expand the gameplay.\\nEach scene is carefully realized, with ceremonial swords, candles burning, flowers, artwork,\\nsandbags and smoke. David Korins, who designed \"Hamilton\" for the stage, consulted on the look\\nof the simulator and offered his tweaks. There are also Easter eggs, or hidden messages in the\\ngame, such as a scene in the Public Theater. That\\'s a nod to the off-Broadway space where\\n\"Hamilton\" premiered.\\nEdelman says that \"Hamilton\" has a timeless feel and that\\'s what makes it successful in the Roblox\\nworld. \"It has that innate feel of belonging everywhere,\" he also says.\\nThe genesis of the idea came from Maggie Brohn, the executive producer for \"Hamilton\"\\nworldwide and chief operating officer of Adventureland LCC, the lead producer for \"Hamilton\"', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.7979441543041786), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5c43e23e-26a7-4d7d-9284-205c1a14ef8b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'hamilton-roblox-2001041877-article_only.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3598df74-9741-4465-a781-c0acee264e3e', node_type=None, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'hamilton-roblox-2001041877-article_only.pdf'}, hash='0a2dc3894b1cdb1b0cfde200218f189f5a35e2596ce3f077a258092e593f6252')}, hash='0a2dc3894b1cdb1b0cfde200218f189f5a35e2596ce3f077a258092e593f6252', text='This article is available at 5 reading levels at https://newsela.com.If you’ve ever wanted to be in “Hamilton,” you\\ncan now do so — on Roblox\\nThis screenshot provided by Super League shows game avatars from the \"Hamilton\" simulator for Roblox.
