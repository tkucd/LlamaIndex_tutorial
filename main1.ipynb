These clever seals know and are happily sharing their secrets With tracking devices attached to their heads, seals can provide us with more information about the ocean floor when they deep dive. Photo: Clive R. McMahon/IMOS/SIMS Photo: Clive R. McMahon/IMOS/SIMS Seals are helping scientists to better understand the deep ocean. Clive McMahon works on an elephant seal tagging project at the University of Tasmania in Australia. He also works with the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS). McMahon said that deep-diving seals can provide scientists with a wealth of information on the structure of the ocean floor. To gather this information, McMahon and his team attached small satellite-linked devices to seals. (A satellite is a machine that orbits the planet. Some satellites send radio signals that can be used to track things down on Earth.) The devices took measurements of temperature and depth as the seals swam. McMahon\\'s team tracked more than 500,000 individual seal dives beneath the East Antarctic continental shelf. A continental shelf is the edge of a continent that lies under the ocean.By Australian Geographic, adapted by Newsela staf f on 09.17.23 Word Count 662 Level 1040L\", \"page_label: 2 file_name: clever-seals-dive-deep-2001041616-article_only.pdf  This article is available at 5 reading levels at https://newsela.com. Image 1. The satellite-linked devices measure water conditions as the seals swim at deep depths in the ocean. Photo: Clive R. McMahon/IMOS/SIMSContinents are the seven main divisions of land on Earth. Seals in the East Antarctic continental shelf region have been equipped with satellite-linked devices since 2004. \\\\\"Only a small part of the Antarctic continental shelf was surveyed by ships in the past,\\\\\" McMahon said. \\\\\"So the information available about this area is sparse.\\\\\" But seals are helping scientists fill in the pieces to this puzzle. In July 2023, McMahon and his team published a study about their work with deep-diving seals. The study was published in a scientific journal. Seals Prove Previous Depth Estimates W rong Information from seal dives is helping scientists understand how the ocean affects Antarctica\\'s role in global climate. Climate refers to weather patterns over a long period of time, usually 30 years or more. \\\\\"We found in some regions that more than 25 percent of previous estimates of the ocean depths were wrong,\\\\\" said Mark Hindell, who also worked on the study. \\\\\"We only know this now because the seals were diving hundreds of meters below those depths.\\\\\" In extreme cases, he says, they dove more than 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) deeper than what scientists thought was the bottom of the ocean. The data, or information, from the dives also revealed new underwater features. They revealed new troughs. A trough is a long, wide and deep sunken area in the ocean floor. Thanks to the seals, the scientists also found a deep canyon near the Vanderford Glacier. A glacier is a slow-moving river of ice hundreds or thousands of meters deep. Observations Help Scientists Measure Melt Rates The observations collected from the seals are helping scientists better understand the shape of the ocean floor, especially where there are channels for warm water to access ice shelf cavities, said McMahon. Ice shelves are floating pieces of ice. They extend from grounded glaciers on land. Sometimes, empty holes known as cavities form on the underside of ice shelves. The cavities allow warm water to reach and melt more of the ice. \\\\\"This knowledge is essential for scientists trying to measure ice sheet melt rates,\\\\\" McMahon said. An ice sheet, also known as a continental glacier, is a chunk of glacier ice that covers the land surrounding it and is greater than 50,000 kilometers (20,000 miles) wide. The East Antarctic ice sheet is particularly important as it locks in more than 52 meters (171 feet) of global sea level rise. Sea level rise is a measurement of how fast our planet is changing. As global temperature goes up, ice trapped on land begins to melt, and sea level rises. Water also expands as its temperature increases. \\\\\"As the climate changes, greater intrusions of warm water into the shelf cavities are more likely,\\\\\" Hindell said. Data from satellite-tagged seals can help scientists understand this process. It can help them figure out exactly where water is coming into contact with the bottom of ice shelves.\", \"page_label: 3 file_name: clever-seals-dive-deep-2001041616-article_only.pdf  This article is available at 5 reading levels at https://newsela.com.Hindell said that this data will help scientists study many factors that affect our future oceans and climate.\", \"page_label: 1 file_name: hamilton-roblox-2001041877-article_only.pdf  This article is available at 5 reading levels at https://newsela.com.If you\\\\u2019ve ever wanted to be in \\\\u201cHamilton,\\\\u201d you can now do so \\\\u2014 on Roblox This screenshot provided by Super League shows game avatars from the \\\\\"Hamilton\\\\\" simulator for Roblox.

The \\\\\"Hamilton\\\\\" simulator players assemble a squad from characters in the musical to confront the redcoats, or the British army. Victories earn coins, which can be used to better arm companions as stronger enemies lurk. The 10 settings include a tavern, George Washington\\'s office, town squares, the ballroom where Hamilton and his wife, Angelica Schuyler, fall in love and the Battle of Yorktown. Each level has songs from the musical, including \\\\\"Guns and Ships,\\\\\" \\\\\"You\\'ll Be Back\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Schuyler Sisters.\\\\\" The songs are also used as a sort of sonic laser to wear down and defeat enemies. \\\\\"For us, being able to allow the player to connect to the characters and the music was really important.

The cast album was similarly a hit with people who hadn\\'t yet seen the show. Edelman says it is not easy to move a piece of intellectual property like a Broadway musical into a new medium. However, the impact on both fans and those unfamiliar with \\\\\"Hamilton\\\\\" is clear. \\\\\"The music brought people to \\'Hamilton\\' in some cases before the actual production of the show brought them there,\\\\\" says Edelman. \\\\\"I don\\'t think this will be any different if we achieve our primary goal, which is to make this a fun gameplay experience that attracts the Roblox community.\\\\\"\"], \"model\": \"text-embedding-ada-002\", \"encoding_format\": \"base64\"}' message='Post details'\n",
